# project_intern_elevatelabs
The final project of the internship at Elevate Labs, this repo has 2 projects inside it.

# Final Project â€“ Data Analyst Internship

Welcome to the combined repository for my Data Analyst Internship. This repository showcases two complete, end-to-end projects built using Python, Power BI, and supporting tools like SQL and SHAP. These projects reflect real-world analytical workflows focused on business impact, predictive modeling, and interactive dashboards.

## ðŸ”¹ Project 1: Retail Business Performance

**Objective:**  
Analyze a Superstore dataset to uncover profit-draining segments, regional trends, and customer behavior, and visualize the results using Power BI.

**Tech Stack:**  
`Python (Pandas, Seaborn)` â€¢ `Power BI` â€¢ `SQL (Optional)`

**Highlights:**
- Cleaned and prepared data using Python
- Designed a dynamic Power BI dashboard with regional and category filters
- Identified sales vs. profit discrepancies
- Optional SQL queries were used to group and summarize key metrics

**Deliverables:**
- Power BI Dashboard (`.pbix`)
- Cleaned Dataset (`.csv`)
- Optional SQL Scripts (`.sql`)
- Project Report (`Retail Business Performance.pdf`)

## ðŸ”¹ Project 2: HR Attrition Prediction & Explainability

**Objective:**  
Build a machine learning model to predict employee attrition and explain influencing factors using SHAP values and visual dashboards.

**Tech Stack:**  
`Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, SHAP)` â€¢ `Power BI`

**Highlights:**
- Performed EDA to understand attrition patterns across departments and job roles
- Built a Logistic Regression model to classify attrition
- Conducted model explainability using SHAP value analysis
- Designed a multi-page Power BI dashboard:
  - Attrition Breakdown
  - Actual vs. Predicted
  - SHAP Value Insights
  - Suggestions & Strategy Page

**Deliverables:**
- Power BI Dashboard (`.pbix`)
- Cleaned + Model Output + SHAP Datasets (`.csv`)
- Trained Model File (`.pkl`)
- Project Report (`HR Attrition Analysis.pdf`)
